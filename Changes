      - Updated README for Windows instructions

      - Fixed a bug reported in Debian bug 203467
        An invalid config setting (such as Lang = "xx") was
        causing a segfault.
        Was freeing the config option between creating the speller
        and checking for errors.  The free was clearing the error status.

      - Fixed Debian bug 203516
        Was not correctly extending arg stack when pusing suggesions onto
        an array.

      - Closed Debian bug 203517
        User was trying to modify the config settings (specifically the
        "lang" setting) after creating a speller object.  That doesn't
        work because creating a speller object is what maps the config
        options to a given dictionary file.
        Documentation updated to clear up this point.



0.02  Sat Aug 31 14:58:31 UTC 2002

      - Added new method:
         @dicts = $speller->dictionary_info;
         returns hash ref instead of a : joined string

      - Added new method:
        @option_list = $speller->get_option_as_list( $option_name );
        returns the option setting as a list (since some options are lists)

      - Added new method:
        $options = $speller->fetch_option_keys;
        returns the available config options and their defaults

      - Removed option_list array.

      - Added list_dictionaries() method to list available dictionaries
        and added test.
